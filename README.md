## Introduction

Stock markets are highly dynamic and influenced by numerous factors. This project utilizes historical stock price data to build a predictive model using LSTM networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels in time series forecasting. The predictions can guide investment strategies by providing insights into potential market movements.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing data, normalization, and preparation of time series data for model training.
- **Model Training:** Implements LSTM networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** Provides graphical representations of the predicted vs. actual stock prices over time.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabirkohli123/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the model training and prediction:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook StockPricePredictionNew.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the LSTM model, and evaluate predictions.

3. (Optional) Deploy the model using the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
